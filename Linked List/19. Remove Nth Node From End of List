Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz

Solution.
/*Approach:
1. start the traversal from a dummy node before head
2. take two node slow, fast and move the fast to n steps
3. then move both nodes until fast one hits end
4. at that position skip the node after the slow node.

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy;
        ListNode slow = dummy;

        while(n > 0) {
            fast = fast.next;
            n--;
        }

        while(fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
